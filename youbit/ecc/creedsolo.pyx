Reed Solomon
============

A cython implementation of an `universal errors-and-erasures Reed-Solomon Codec <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction>`_
, based on the wonderful tutorial at
`wikiversity <http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_codes_for_coders>`_,
written by "Bobmath" and "LRQ3000".

The code of wikiversity is here consolidated into a nice API with exceptions handling.
The algorithm can correct up to 2*e+v <= nsym, where e is the number of errors,
v the number of erasures and nsym = n-k = the number of ECC (error correction code) symbols.
This means that you can either correct exactly floor(nsym/2) errors, or nsym erasures
(errors where you know the position), and a combination of both errors and erasures.
The code should work on pretty much any reasonable version of python (2.4-3.2),
but I'm only testing on 2.5-3.2.

.. note::
   The codec is universal, meaning that it can decode any message encoded by another RS encoder
   as long as you provide the correct parameters.
   Note however that even if the algorithms and calculations can support Galois Fields > 2^8, the
   current implementation is based on bytearray structures to get faster computations. But this is
   easily fixable, just change bytearray to array('i', [...]) and it should work flawlessly for any GF.

   The algorithm itself can handle messages up to (2^c_exp)-1 symbols, including the ECC symbols,
   and each symbol can only have a value of up to (2^c_exp)-1. By default, we use the field GF(2^8),
   which means that you are limited to values between 0 and 255 (perfect to represent a single hexadecimal
   symbol on computers, so you can encode any binary stream) and limited to messages+ecc of maximum
   length 255. However, you can "chunk" longer messages to fit them into the message length limit.
   The ``RSCodec`` class will automatically apply chunking, by splitting longer messages into chunks and
   encode/decode them separately; it shouldn't make a difference from an API perspective (ie, from your POV).

::

    >>> rs = RSCodec(10)
    >>> rs.encode([1,2,3,4])
    b'\x01\x02\x03\x04,\x9d\x1c+=\xf8h\xfa\x98M'
    >>> rs.encode(b'hello world')
    b'hello world\xed%T\xc4\xfd\xfd\x89\xf3\xa8\xaa'
    >>> rs.decode(b'hello world\xed%T\xc4\xfd\xfd\x89\xf3\xa8\xaa')
    b'hello world'
    >>> rs.decode(b'heXlo worXd\xed%T\xc4\xfdX\x89\xf3\xa8\xaa')     # 3 errors
    b'hello world'
    >>> rs.decode(b'hXXXo worXd\xed%T\xc4\xfdX\x89\xf3\xa8\xaa')     # 5 errors
    b'hello world'
    >>> rs.decode(b'hXXXo worXd\xed%T\xc4\xfdXX\xf3\xa8\xaa')        # 6 errors - fail
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    ReedSolomonError: Could not locate error

    >>> rs = RSCodec(12)
    >>> rs.encode(b'hello world')
    b'hello world?Ay\xb2\xbc\xdc\x01q\xb9\xe3\xe2='
    >>> rs.decode(b'hello worXXXXy\xb2XX\x01q\xb9\xe3\xe2=')         # 6 errors - ok
    b'hello world'

    If you want full control, you can skip the API and directly use the library as-is. Here's how:

    First you need to init the precomputed tables:
    >> init_tables(0x11d)
    Pro tip: if you get the error: ValueError: byte must be in range(0, 256), please check that your prime polynomial is correct for your field.

    Then to encode:
    >> mesecc = rs_encode_msg(mes, n-k)

    To decode:
    >> mes, ecc, errata_pos = rs_correct_msg(mes + ecc, n-k, erase_pos=erase_pos)
    
    If the decoding fails, it will normally automatically check and raise a ReedSolomonError exception that you can handle.
    However if you want to manually check if the repaired message is correct, you can do so:
    >> rsman.check(rmes + recc, k=k)

    Read the sourcecode's comments for more infos about how it works, and for the various parameters you can setup if
    you need to interface with other RS codecs.

    '''Compute the list of prime polynomials for the given generator and galois field characteristic exponent.'''
    # fast_primes will output less results but will be significantly faster.
    # single will output the first prime polynomial found, so if all you want is to just find one prime polynomial to generate the LUT for Reed-Solomon to work, then just use that.

    # A prime polynomial (necessarily irreducible) is necessary to reduce the multiplications in the Galois Field, so as to avoid overflows.
    # Why do we need a "prime polynomial"? Can't we just reduce modulo 255 (for GF(2^8) for example)? Because we need the values to be unique.
    # For example: if the generator (alpha) = 2 and c_exp = 8 (GF(2^8) == GF(256)), then the generated Galois Field (0, 1, a, a^1, a^2, ..., a^(p-1)) will be galois field it becomes 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. However, upon reaching 128, the next value will be doubled (ie, next power of 2), which will give 256. Then we must reduce, because we have overflowed above the maximum value of field_charac. But, if we modulo field_charac, this will generate 256 == 1. Then 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. giving us a repeating pattern of numbers. This is very bad, as it's then not anymore a bijection (ie, a non-zero value doesn't have a unique index). That's why we can't just modulo 255, but we need another number above 255, which is called the prime polynomial.
    # Why so much hassle? Because we are using precomputed look-up tables for multiplication: instead of multiplying a*b, we precompute alpha^a, alpha^b and alpha^(a+b), so that we can just use our lookup table at alpha^(a+b) and get our result. But just like in our original field we had 0,1,2,...,p-1 distinct unique values, in our "LUT" field using alpha we must have unique distinct values (we don't care that they are different from the original field as long as they are unique and distinct). That's why we need to avoid duplicated values, and to avoid duplicated values we need to use a prime irreducible polynomial.

    # Here is implemented a bruteforce approach to find all these prime polynomials, by generating every possible prime polynomials (ie, every integers between field_charac+1 and field_charac*2), and then we build the whole Galois Field, and we reject the candidate prime polynomial if it duplicates even one value or if it generates a value above field_charac (ie, cause an overflow).
    # Note that this algorithm is slow if the field is too big (above 12), because it's an exhaustive search algorithm. There are probabilistic approaches, and almost surely prime approaches, but there is no determistic polynomial time algorithm to find irreducible monic polynomials.

    These tables are used for multiplication/division since addition/substraction are simple XOR operations inside GF of characteristic 2.
    The basic idea is quite simple: since b**(log_b(x), log_b(y)) == x * y given any number b (the base or generator of the logarithm), then we can use any number b to precompute logarithm and anti-log (exponentiation) tables to use for multiplying two numbers x and y.
    That's why when we use a different base/generator number, the log and anti-log tables are drastically different, but the resulting computations are the same given any such tables.

It's a polynomial in the binary sense: each bit is a coefficient, but in fact it's an integer between field_charac+1 and field_charac*2, and not a list of gf values. The prime polynomial will be used to reduce the overflows back into the range of the Galois Field without duplicating values (all values should be unique). See the function find_prime_polys() and: http://research.swtch.com/field and http://www.pclviewer.com/rs2/galois.html
    # note that the choice of generator or prime polynomial doesn't matter very much: any two finite fields of size p^n have identical structure, even if they give the individual elements different names (ie, the coefficients of the codeword will be different, but the final result will be the same: you can always correct as many errors/erasures with any choice for those parameters). That's why it makes sense to refer to all the finite fields, and all decoders based on Reed-Solomon, of size p^n as one concept: GF(p^n).
